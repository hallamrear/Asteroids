<p>A space themed classic arcade shooter! This is a rendition of the classic game Asteroids from 1979. Controlling a single spaceship in an asteroid field, the objective of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids to avoid them hitting you and blowing you up! In the future, I'd like to continue working on this and adding the flying saucers from the original game but for now, it works.</p>
